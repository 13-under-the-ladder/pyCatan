	- cannot override existing roads

	- TODO charge for later roads

7. Robber
	- difficulty in dragging object - not sure Tkinter has explicit support for this

	- TODO create sprite
	- TODO allow card discarding

8. GUI
	- create a "God" window which shows contents of each player's hand similar to what exists now
		- this will allow me to monitor ebb and flow of resources

	- create a top bar which shows only content of current player's hand
		- this will allow me to select resources to discard
		- I could draw a mock-up of this...

	- GUI "cannot afford development card" error appears when you run out of development cards

	- generate player names - naming them for colours is not great

	- game over conditions not detected
