1. Generate a Catan map
	- TODO ports
	- done except for ports
	
2. Render the Catan map
	- TODO ports
	- done except for ports
	
3. Settlement / city placement
	- created map of nodes to hexes
	- added recognition of nodes clicked
	- allow placing settlements for one player
	- allow upgrading to city for one player
	
	- TODO charge resources
	- TODO allow multiple colors
	
	- TODO create settlement and city sprites
	
	
4. Resource distribution
	- created map of numbers to hexes
	- resources are distributed based on settlement and city placement
	- cities earn twice as much as settlements
	
	- TODO store resources earned somewhere
	
5. Road-building
	- TODO add [invisible] buttons between (adjacent) nodes
		- this is going to be difficult
		
		- adjacent roads
			- we start with each player having a set of nodes as their road nexi
			- each road nexi is a valid start-point for a road segment
			- end-point of road segment must be adjacent to road-nexus chosen
			
		
			- same tile
				- +- 1 index btw/ nodes (rollover case at 0, but Python allows neg. indexing so no big deal)
			- different tiles
				- no such thing, road nexus will always be on same tile
				- nexus can be on several tiles at once
	- 
	
6. Initial placement
	- place 1 settlement and 1 city
	
	TODO
		- how to assign multiple tags to canvas item
		- how to wait for <specific> user input?
