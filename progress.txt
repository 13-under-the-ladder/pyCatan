9. GUI
	- create a "God" window which shows contents of each player's hand similar to what exists now
		- this will allow me to monitor ebb and flow of resources

	- create a top bar which shows only content of current player's hand
		- this will allow me to select resources to discard
		- I could draw a mock-up of this...

	- generate player names - naming them for colours is not great

	- game does not end on game over condition. message is displayed but play continues

	- buttons should be greyed out when purchasing option is not available

	- sometimes settlements are placed instead of roads
