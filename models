A list of representations so I don't get lost...

1. How to get which settlements/cities produce?
a) resource_map maps numbers to hexes
b) each hex stores all its vertices
c) _settlements maps vertices to settlements/cities (tuple of player color and level)
==> for r in resource_map[number]:
		for v in r.get_vertices():
			for color
