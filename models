A list of representations so I don't get lost...

1. How to get which settlements/cities produce?
a) resource_map maps numbers to hexes
b) each hex stores all its vertices
c) _settlements maps vertices to settlements/cities (tuple of player color and level)
==> for r in resource_map[number]:
		for v in r.get_vertices():
			if v in settlements:
				if settlements[v].is_city():
					# produce 2
				else:
					# produce 1
					
2. How to build settlements always 2 away from each other
=> cannot be next to each other
=> have to be able to get neighbouring vertices

3. How to build roads next to settlements
=> must be same color as settlement
=> check both extremities
